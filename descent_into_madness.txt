I found a strange album on Bandcamp. It is the "The Bike Horn Collection" by aberrantkenosis and contains a file named "corhorns.sf2", which is apparently a "SoundFont".

I figured out how to use the SoundFont to create songs. I make a bike horn version of the Madoka Magica OP "Connect" and upload it to my new YouTube channel.

Experimenting with SoundFonts, I create one using a clip of Misako saying "Shinji you fucker!" and make a cover of "A Cruel Angel's Thesis". It's truly awful and I decide to stick to the bike horn SoundFont. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L1Po5kTZ50

My Madoka Magica honk song hits 200 views and is my most popular video.

I've been making honk songs for a bit now but haven't found a good theme to give each video. I begin overlaying bike-related scenes from anime at 2% opacity and fulfill requests for the first person to correctly identify the anime I used. Triggerhappypilot correctly identifies the anime and requests that I watch Penguindrum. As of November 2017 I still haven't watched it. Fuck you Trigger. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4p6ZD4f8ac

I discover Primantiss's channel, which consists of Chen videos. I am inspired to use Chen as the mascot of all my future honk songs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5RnmpNHWuQ

I make and upload a honk parody of Kom Susser Tod, or "Honking Down Honking Down Honking Down". it becomes my most popular honk song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdss-U0H7fA
